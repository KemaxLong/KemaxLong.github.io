    <h2 class="research-q">Reflections sprint 2</h2>
 
<ol>
    <li>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</li>
    <p>Ghosting someone might be a ethical decison that i have made. when i was youger, i used to end up a relatihonship by not responding to the my friend at all, by just ignoring them,rather than telling them i would like to the relationship. Ghosting seems like the easy way out for the one ghosting, but it's hard for the one being ghosted to find closure and move on</p>
    <li>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</li>
    <p>“We Chinese believe that humility is a kind of virtue. We have an old proverb that says “Pride leads to loss, while modesty brings benefit.” So, one shouldn't praise oneself. When we talk about ourselves or our things we usually do it in self-effacing terms.</p>
    <li>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</li>
    <p>I think my best strength is being a team player. I enjoy working in a team environment, and I get along well with people. 

      I think it's also a great process in that team members with certain strengths balance out people with certain weaknesses and we can all learn from each other.
      </p>
    <li>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</li>
    <p>I tend to focus too much on the details, which means I sometimes get curious and distracted by a little thing of a project – In my uni life, sometimes I can end up spending one or two hours reading something that’s only very slightly relevant to the project.</p>
    <li>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</li>
    <p>I once disagreed with my boss over how to best help a customer. Rather than question his 
      authority in front of everyone, I talked to him off of the floor. I was open and honest about the problems I had with the way he wanted to do things. It turned out that there was just a simple misunderstanding. That disagreement we had showed me the importance of communicating with my coworkers to make sure that something obsolete doesn’t become a bigger problem than it needs to be.
