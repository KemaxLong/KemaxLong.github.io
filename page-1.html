    <p>ID selectors are defined using a hash sign. They are immediately followed by the ID value that you want to apply a set of style rules to. Here is an example of the ID selector in action:</p>
    <p class="center-words"><img src="../styles/Ids-css.png" alt="blog-pic" width="300" height="100">      <img src="../styles/ids-html.png" alt="blog-pic" width="500" height="100">
    
    </p>
    <p class="center-words">
       This style applies to the p element in our HTML document with the ID "email . The style will set  the color of the text in the element to black and potition to center, the font size to 10px
      </p>
      <p>Class selectors are defined using a period, followed by the value of the class that you want to apply a set of styles to. Hereâ€™s an example of the class selector in action:</p>
      <p class="center-words"><img src="../styles/class-css.png" alt="blog-pic" width="300" height="100">      <img src="../styles/class-html.png" alt="blog-pic" width="500" height="100">></p>
      <p class="center-words">This style sets the background color of our div tag to lightgreen. </p>
